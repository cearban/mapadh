{HOST}

- we now have this domain: cearbangeo.co.uk (for 1 yr @ £1.20)

#TODO:can we use GitHub pages to quickly get some placeholder up there?
#  https://pages.github.com/
#   we now have: https://cearban.github.io/
#    we need to use our custom cearbangeo.co.uk domain to point to https://cearban.github.io/ as a placeholder...

- and we now have a $12/mo shared host with opalstack for maphacking purposes...

#TODO: get some simple flask app running on the opalstack host
# having "deployed" it via Git, having worked on it`s development here on pentlands...

# we run Py apps on opalstack using wsgi?

{API standing-up / consuming}

for mapadh:

#TODO: work on the API
# i.e. what "functionality" do we want to provide?

#TODO: consume the API from JS etc

#TODO: we downloaded OS Open Roads as a Geopackage which has road links and nodes
# in theory we could use for drivetime analysis (or walktime analysis along roads)
#  i.e. combine with stations to find buffer with distance defined as the walktime distance between current flat and Haymarket.

#TODO: as per the original paper find OAs within 200m and if more than 1 do an average

{APP}

#TODO: revisit OpenLayers

#TODO: look at maplibre / vector tile type stuff

{DATA}

#TODO: load in 2021 data (from GeoLytix again)


{MAPS}

follow this: https://chenzhang.org/notes/developer/mapserver-installation/

ignoring the php stuff as I don`t care about mapscript

stick map_config/censustrips.map under the /var/www directory (need to revisit how we config apache correctly!)

then we can make WMS GetMap request like this:

http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/var/www/censustrips.map
&SERVICE=WMS
&VERSION=1.1.1
&REQUEST=GetMap
&LAYERS=scotland_oa_2011
&STYLES=
&SRS=EPSG:27700
&BBOX=320000,670000,325000,675000
&WIDTH=400
&HEIGHT=300
&FORMAT=image/png

then maybe revisit mapproxy etc!

#TODO: research / setup map provider(s)

# this provides service / api for free OSM mapping!
# so follow their guide to provide OSM background mapping for a mapadh app
# i.e. in MapLibre etc

https://openfreemap.org/
https://openfreemap.org/quick_start/

#TODO: since this removes the ballache of rolling our own OSM solution / other providers, maybe bung them $5 / month donation
# https://github.com/sponsors/hyperknot
#  i.e. we pay $11.50 (opalstack hosting) + $5 donation for osm openfreemap mapping
#   = $16.50 / mo
#     = £12.39 / mo (~ same as 11.98/mo for amazon prime ad free) - different form of fun!
